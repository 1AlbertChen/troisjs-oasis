# TroisJS Weather Website Demo

This demo is inspired by the cool 2D weather effect on the iOS weather app. It's my attempt to use TroisJS, an open-source 3D graphics library based on Vue and Three.js, to simulate different weather conditions in 3D. It's also my imitation of the fancy 3D websites you find on places like Awwwards.

I plan to turn this into a website that displays the weather at your location with 3D graphics once I find more suitable free 3D models and add a weather API.
