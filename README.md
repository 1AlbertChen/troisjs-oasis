# TroisJS Experimental Weather App
The weather app on iPhone gets fancier following each update. Now you get cool visual effects for different weathers. This is my attempt to use TroisJS, a Vue/Three.js framework to create 3D visual effects for different weather conditions. This is still a work in progress and the live website is only a demo. I'm still working on connecting the website to a weather API and finding suitable 3D assests.
